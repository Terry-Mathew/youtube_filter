TASK_021: Set up production deployment pipeline

DESCRIPTION:
Configure Vercel deployment with environment variables and Supabase connections for Vite build. This task sets up the complete production deployment pipeline optimized for Vite + React + Supabase architecture.

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE:
- FROM: Next.js deployment (next.config.js, Next.js specific configs)
- TO: Vite deployment (vite.config.ts, Vite build optimizations)

DEPENDENCIES:
- TASK_020 (Error handling) - Ensures robust production error handling

ANTICIPATES:
- Production launch and user onboarding

FILES TO MODIFY:
1. vercel.json
   - Vite-specific build configuration
   - SPA routing configuration for React Router
   - Environment variable settings
   - Build output directory configuration
   - Redirect rules for client-side routing

2. .env.example
   - Complete environment variable template
   - Supabase configuration variables
   - API key placeholders
   - Production vs development configurations
   - Documentation for each variable

3. vite.config.ts
   - Production build optimizations
   - Bundle splitting and code organization
   - Environment variable handling
   - Build performance optimizations
   - Asset optimization settings

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. Vercel Configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "dist",
     "devCommand": "npm run dev",
     "installCommand": "npm install",
     "framework": null,
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Environment Variables:
   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL (Supabase project URL)
   - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (Supabase anonymous key)
   - VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT (production/staging/development)
   - VITE_YOUTUBE_API_QUOTA_LIMIT (optional quota monitoring)
   - VITE_OPENAI_MODEL (default AI model configuration)

3. Vite Build Configuration:
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Tree shaking configuration
   - CSS optimization
   - Asset compression
   - Source map configuration for production

4. Supabase Integration:
   - Database connection validation
   - Edge function deployment (if needed)
   - Row Level Security verification
   - Migration deployment strategy

5. Performance Optimizations:
   - Lazy loading for route components
   - Code splitting by feature
   - Asset preloading strategies
   - Service worker configuration (optional)

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE:

1. Pre-deployment Checks:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint validation
   - Unit test execution
   - Build process verification
   - Environment variable validation

2. Build Process:
   - Clean build directory
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Asset optimization
   - Bundle generation
   - Source map creation

3. Deployment Steps:
   - Vercel deployment
   - Environment variable injection
   - Database migration (if needed)
   - Health check verification
   - Rollback preparation

4. Post-deployment Validation:
   - Application health checks
   - Supabase connection verification
   - API endpoint testing
   - Performance monitoring setup

MONITORING AND ANALYTICS:

1. Error Tracking:
   - Integration with existing error boundaries
   - Production error logging
   - Performance monitoring
   - User experience tracking

2. Performance Metrics:
   - Core Web Vitals monitoring
   - Bundle size tracking
   - Load time optimization
   - API response time monitoring

3. Security Monitoring:
   - Environment variable security
   - API key usage monitoring
   - Supabase security audit
   - Access pattern analysis

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- ✓ Successful Vercel deployment
- ✓ All environment variables properly configured
- ✓ Supabase connection works in production
- ✓ Client-side routing functions correctly
- ✓ Build process completes without errors
- ✓ Performance metrics meet targets
- ✓ Error handling works in production
- ✓ Security configurations are active

PRODUCTION CHECKLIST:
1. Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard
2. Supabase project configured for production
3. Domain configuration (if custom domain)
4. SSL certificate setup
5. Performance monitoring enabled
6. Error tracking configured
7. Analytics integration (optional)
8. Backup and recovery procedures documented

ROLLBACK STRATEGY:
1. Previous deployment preservation
2. Database migration rollback procedures
3. Environment variable version control
4. Quick rollback command documentation
5. Emergency contact procedures

INTEGRATION NOTES:
- This deployment supports the full Vite + Supabase architecture
- Environment variable naming follows Vite conventions (VITE_ prefix)
- Configuration supports both staging and production environments
- Deployment pipeline integrates with existing CI/CD workflows
- Performance optimizations maintain development experience
